/**
  ðŸ’¥ Challenge: Deathmatch Shooting Game
  
  ðŸ“‹ Specifications
    You are to create a deathmatch shooting game between two players.

  Each player will have four attributes:
    name
    health
    power
    speed

  The gameplay is turn-based, and new players are generated every round.
  These new players inherit 10% ~ 150% of the previous round's stats.
  The game ends when one player is defeated.

  ðŸ§  Behavior and Mechanics
  
  ðŸ‘¤ Player Class
    Properties:
      name: string
      health: number (default: 100)
      power: number (default: 10)
      speed: number (default: 10)

    Methods:
      damage(power: number): Decreases the player's health by power.
      useItem(item: BoostItem):
        Applies a boost item:
        health +10 if the item is a HealthBoost
        power +10 if the item is a PowerBoost
      showStatus(): Logs playerâ€™s current status:
        â†’ Example: "Player A (Health => 100, Power => 10, Speed => 15)"
      cloneWithRandomStatsMultiplier(): Returns a new player based on the current one, with health, power, and speed randomly scaled by 10% to 150%.

  ðŸŽ® ShootingGame Class
  Create a ShootingGame class with:
    Constructor:
      constructor(player1: Player, player2: Player)
    Methods:
      getRandomItem(player: Player): BoostItem: Randomly give either:
        { health: +10 } or { power: +10 }, and apply it to the player.
      start(): Starts the game.
  
  Each round:
    Generate new players for both player1 and player2 using cloneWithRandomStatsMultiplier().
    Assign random item boosts to each player.
    Determine who goes first by comparing their speed. The player with higher speed attacks first.
    Execute turn-based shooting.
    Continue until one player's health drops to 0 or below.
    Declare winner and proceed to the next round, regenerating new players again from the winnerâ€™s stats.
